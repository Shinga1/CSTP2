                Our Story
                <br></br>
                As fellow second year computer science students, many of us like using celebrity products. 
                Many of us use Dr.Dre's Beats headphones, and also various celebrity perfumes. Even though 
                we enjoy using these products, we found that it is very hard to find a single website that 
                sells all the celebrity related products that we use. We would have to go to one website 
                to buy headphones and another website to buy perfumes and another website to buy books. 
                The shopping experience ends up being draining which is why we founded Celessentials.
                <br></br>
                The one stop for all your celebrity needs for all the celebrity fantics out there.

            <h3>Defective or Damaged Products</h3>
            <p>At Celessentials, we take pride in providing our customers with high-quality celebrity-related products.
                If you receive a faulty or damaged product, please contact us immediately. You may refuse to accept
                delivery of the product if it arrives damaged or leaked. However, if you have already received the
                product and discover any damage, please provide photographic evidence within 7 days of receipt. After 7
                days, we will no longer be able to issue a refund. Our team will assist you in obtaining a complete
                refund (including all shipping expenses) or sending out a replacement product.</p>
            <h3>Incorrect or Unwanted Products</h3>
            <p>If you wish to return an unwanted product, you may do so within 7 days of the shipment date. Please
                contact our team for assistance. Please note that you must not have broken any seals or opened the
                product's container. The product must be in its original, undamaged, and unopened condition. You will be
                responsible for re-packaging the product and paying for any associated postage or shipping charges.</p>
            <h3>Non-Returnable Products</h3>
            <p>For health and safety reasons, we are unable to accept returns on any opened drinks.</p>

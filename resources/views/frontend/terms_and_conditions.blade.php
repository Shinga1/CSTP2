            <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
                behalf
                of an entity ("you") and Celessentials ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), concerning your access to and
                use of the website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application
                related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the "Site"). You agree that by accessing
                the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. If you do not
                agree with all of these Terms of Use, then you are expressly prohibited from using the Site and you must

                such
                distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration
                requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the
                Site
                from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local

                jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be
                directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Site. If you are a minor, you must have your
                parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Use prior to you using the Site.</p>
